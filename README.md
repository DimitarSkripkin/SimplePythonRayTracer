## Project goals

To refresh my knowledge in analytic geometry.
To help me understand how ray tracers work.

Support at least:

- [ ] basic back tracer and/or path tracer
- [ ] simple reflection
- [ ] simple refraction
- [ ] simple shadows

## Used pip dependencies

```bash
# used to display rendered image
pip install wx
# adds vector and matrix support
pip install pyglm
```

## Disclaimer

This project should not be considered as an example of best practices.
I don't have deep understanding in either how python or ray tracers work. :)
